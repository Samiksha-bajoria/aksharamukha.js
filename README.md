# Aksharamukha.js
Aksharamukha in your browser!

## Description
This project aspires to be a browser-compatible version of the [Aksharamukha](https://www.aksharamukha.com/) and its [Python library](https://github.com/virtualvinodh/aksharamukha-python), which is a transliteration tool for Indic scripts.

The goal is to enable users to perform script conversions directly in their web browsers without needing to rely on server-side processing.

## Attribution
This project is inspired by and based on the original [Aksharamukha](https://www.aksharamukha.com/) by [Vinodh Rajan](https://github.com/virtualvinodh).
